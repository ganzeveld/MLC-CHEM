# MLC-CHEM
Repository of the Multi-Layer Canopy - CHemistry and Exchange Modelling system (=MLC-CHEM). 

Developed by Laurens Ganzeveld and many contributing users of the modelling system to study atmosphere-biosphere exchange of reactive compounds and aerosols. 
* The model system is especially developed to support analysis of field observations. In a so-called offline set-up the model is driven by first-order estimates of drivers such as radition, wind speed, temperatures, moisture, LAI and roughness, or driven by read-in measured micrometeorological and surface cover parameters and surface/mixed layer tracer concentrations  
* MLC-CHEM can be run both on windows and linux systems, with simulations spanning from some days to multiple years
* One can compare simulated and observed trace gas fluxes and in-canopy concentration gradients as a function of the coupled representation of in-canopy biogenic emissions, dry deposition, chemistry and turbulent transport 
* The role of these canopy processes can also be evaluated by interpretation of process tendencies and by conducting sensitivity experiments (de)activating/modifying these processes 
* This (de)activation/modification of processes/settings can also be largely done by changing settings/switches in a namelist for each specific case study
* More specific details about application of MLC-CHEM for studying atmosphere-biosphere exchange processes and fluxes can be found in a [Manual](https://github.com/ganzeveld/MLC-CHEM/blob/f09148c428623f02c8abdc83506b2f7dbd29a2b6/documentation/Manual_MLC_CHEMv5.pdf). This  manual also contains a reference list including quite some papers showing a range of applications of this modelling system 
* One of the most recent papers by [Visser et al. (2022)](https://github.com/ganzeveld/MLC-CHEM/blob/c0d13c1c11b3495a582ec493c03720d2b8a271ec/documentation/Visser%20et%20al.%20O3%20deposition%20impact%20assessment%20and%20O3%20flux%20partioning%20acp-21-18393-2021.pdf) shows application for an anaylysis of the role of canopy turbulence and soil NO emissions in ozone deposition at the Italian measurements site Bosco Fontana during the ECLAIRE-2012 field campaign 
* The dataset used to constrain the model simulations for this Bosco Fontana case study is also available as one of the [example input datasets](https://github.com/ganzeveld/MLC-CHEM/blob/d84e8fd8967e9c55eee8e3fa69d025b607c737a5/input/BFt_20120624_20120711.inp)
