# MLC-CHEM
Repository of the Multi-Layer Canopy - CHemistry and Exchange Modelling system (=MLC-CHEM). 

Developed by Laurens Ganzeveld and many contributing users of the modelling system to study atmosphere-biosphere exchange of reactive compounds and aerosols. The model system is especially developed to be applied in a so-called offline set-up, driven by read-in, measured micrometeorology and surface/mixed layer tracer concentrations, to support analysis of field observations. One can compare simulated and observed trace gas fluxes and in-canopy concentration gradients as a function of the coupled representation of in-canopy biogenic emissions, dry deposition, chemistry and turbulent transport. The role of these processes can be evaluated by interpretation of the process tendencies and by conducting sensitivity experiments (de)activating/modifying these processes. 

More specific details about application of MLC-CHEM for studying atmosphere-biosphere can be found in the Manual (https://github.com/ganzeveld/MLC-CHEM/blob/f09148c428623f02c8abdc83506b2f7dbd29a2b6/documentation/Manual_MLC_CHEMv5.pdf)

The manual also contains a reference list including quite some papers showing previous applications of this modelling system.
